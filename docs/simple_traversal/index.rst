Pyramid and SQLAlchemy Setup
============================

Pyramid and SQLAlchemy are great friends, but there are different
approaches to integrating the two. ``pyramid_sqlalchemy`` is one, but
uses globals. Recently, the Pyramid scaffold has adopted some best
practices.

In this step we make a Pyramid application based on those best practices.

- Console script

- Pyramid/SQLAlchemy best practices

    - naming convention

    - root factory

- Traversal-based JSON view

- Unit and functional tests
